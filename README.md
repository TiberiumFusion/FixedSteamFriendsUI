# FixedSteamFriendsUI
Patch-and-patcher project which makes modern Steam friends/chat work again in Steam clients abandoned by Valve.
<br/>If you use the May/June/July/August 2023 Steam clients (or earlier) in vgui mode, this patch is for you.

![Drafting](https://github.com/TiberiumFusion/FixedSteamFriendsUI/assets/6332277/12d8238a-93a9-4cc0-9a85-248085d0397b)


## Brief
The Steam client's modern friends/chat feature includes a timebomb. Valve set this timebomb off on September 21st, 2023, breaking modern Steam friends/chat for all vgui-capable Steam clients.

This project restores modern Steam friends/chat to working order for those affected Steam clients, by redirecting the Steam client to run a patched version of friends/chat instead of Valve's broken version.
